# google-homepage
This is my first TOP assignment. 

I'm writing this after having completed the assignment but in future tense as a reflection.

My approach for this project is to break the google homepage into 3 sections: top navigation bar, main contents (search form and logo), and a bottom footer. 

CSS Grid is the layout technique most familiar to me at the moment so it will be my stategy for creating the navigation bars, as well as the 9x9 app icon (top right) while allowing for responsive design. 

Goals: 

-Write organized code with comments and semantic markup (nav, header, form etc) 

-Create a responsive webpage that adapts to viewer size in a similar manner as the original google page. 

-Include faithful styling and :hover effects 

-Learn how to add images to input element

-Learn how to problem solve and isolate issues from within the cascade (not making bandaid solutions) 

-Learn when to use px vs relative units

-Learn when to use relative positioning (top:, left: etc) and when best to use margin:, padding: styling.

-Learn how to review and clean code (removing unecessary divs)
